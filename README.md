# NoteRibbon

## About

I created NoteRibbon on March 23, 2025 because I wanted a much cleaner user interface for the palettes that Noteflight uses in the score editor. I wanted to make a UI that made sense, so I went with a ribbon (a type of UI made of tabs and toolbars), similar to what you would see in Office apps and the File Explorer in Windows 8, 8.1, and 10.

## Footnotes

### 1

In this project, a beta release is a pre-release meant for testing. There are most certainly bugs in a beta release, so betas are released for the community to test and provide feedback on.

### 2

A release candidate is a pre-release that *supposedly* doesn't contain any more bugs, but it isn't ready to be a stable release. When a release candidate number increments, it means that one or more new features were added and more are planned before the stable release.
