# NoteRibbon

## About

I created NoteRibbon on March 23, 2025 because I wanted a much cleaner user interface for the palettes that Noteflight uses in the score editor. I didn't like the messy score palette and I wanted to make a UI that made sense, so I went with a ribbon (a type of UI made of tabs and toolbars) similar to what you'd see in Office apps and the File Explorer in Windows 8, 8.1, and 10.

## Download

You can download the userscript here: [https://github.com/Unseeable8710/NoteRibbon/raw/refs/heads/main/script/NoteRibbon.user.js](https://github.com/Unseeable8710/NoteRibbon/raw/refs/heads/main/script/NoteRibbon.user.js)

It will be available on GreasyFork when I finish the first release.
