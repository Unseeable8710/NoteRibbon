# NoteRibbon

## About

I created NoteRibbon on March 23, 2025 because I wanted a much cleaner user interface for the palettes that Noteflight uses in the score editor. I wanted to make a UI that made sense, so I went with a ribbon (a type of UI made of tabs and toolbars), similar to what you would see in Office apps and the File Explorer in Windows 8, 8.1, and 10.
