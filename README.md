# noteribbon

## about

i created noteribbon on march 23 2025 because i wanted a much cleaner user interface for the palettes that noteflight uses in the score editor. i wanted to make a ui that made sense so i went with a ribbon (a type of ui made of tabs and toolbars) similar to what you would see in office apps and the file explorer in windows 8 8.1 and 10.
